# 2a_Stop_and_Wait_Protocol
## AIM 
To write a python program to perform stop and wait protocol
## ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Get the frame size from the user
3. To create the frame based on the user request.
4. To send frames to server from the client side.
5. If your frames reach the server it will send ACK signal to client
6. Stop the Program

Cient

```
import socket
s = socket.socket()
s.bind(('localhost',8002))
s.listen(5)
c, addr = s.accept()
ListSize = int(input("Enter the number of frames to send : "))
List = list(range(ListSize))
WindowSize = int(input("Enter Window Size : "))
st, i = 0, 0
while True:
    while(i < ListSize):
        st += WindowSize
        c.send(str(List[i:st]).encode())
        Acknowledgment = c.recv(1024).decode()
        if Acknowledgment:
            print(Acknowledgment)
            i+=st
```

Server
```
import socket
s = socket.socket()
s.connect(('localhost', 8002))
while True:
    print(s.recv(1024).decode())
    s.send("Acknowledgement received from the server".encode())


```
